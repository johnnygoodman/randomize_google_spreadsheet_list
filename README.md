Randomize A Google Spreadsheet List Using Ruby, Mech and Google Drive

This is a bit of overkill. If you want to do this really quickly and easily, use the rand() method in a google spreadsheet. 

If you want to publish the source you are using to randomize a list to keep things super transparent, then do these things:

1. Created a spreadsheet. 

2. Paste your list of things to randomize in, one list item per row

3. Share out a read only link to the spreadsheet to the people who want to watch it being randomized. 

4. Run the script. 

Note that this uses dotenv to store needed private variables.
